super_string Project
This project implements a super_string class that manages character strings using a binary tree structure. The super_string class offers various functionalities such as:

Join (juntar): Merges two super_string objects.
Separate (separar): Splits the super_string at a given index.
Add (agregar): Adds a character at the end of the string.
Reverse (reverso): Reverses the content of the super_string using a stack.
Trim (recortar): Returns the approximate height of the resulting tree.
Convert to string (stringizar): Converts the tree structure into a standard string.
Clear (limpiar): Removes all nodes in the tree.
Insert (insertar): Inserts characters from a string at a specified index.
Delete (eliminar): Removes a portion of the super_string between two indices.
The project processes text files, where commands like INSERTAR, ELIMINAR, RECORTAR, REVERSO, and MOSTRAR are executed to manipulate the super_string.

Compilation
This project can be compiled using the g++ compiler.
